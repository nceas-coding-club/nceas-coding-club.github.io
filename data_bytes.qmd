```{r byte-libraries, include = F}
# Put all libraries in this chunk for all bytes to make it easier to update in future

# `shelf::librarian` automatically installs missing packages and loads all packages. It also works for non-CRAN packages without needing to do the whole 'install `remotes` then `install_github`' thing

# install.packages("librarian")
librarian::shelf(palmerpenguins,
                 tidyverse,
                 ggsvg)

### What's a Data Byte?

Data Bytes are our idea for short, helpful coding tips and/or best practices. This page will grow as we add more Bytes so check in from time to time if you find the ones we have so far helpful! Got an idea for a new Data Byte? [Post an Issue](https://github.com/nceas-coding-club/nceas-coding-club.github.io/issues) to share it with us and put it on our radar as a potential future Byte.

The full list of available Data Bytes can be found below. Enjoy!
